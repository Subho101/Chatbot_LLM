python -m venv <env_name>
```
Activate the virtual environment:

On macOS/Linux:

```
source <env_name>/bin/activate

On Windows:

```
<env_name>\Scripts\activate
```

3. Configure the OpenAI API Key
You will need to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. Replace <OPENAI_API_KEY> with your actual OpenAI API key.

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<OPENAI_API_KEY>
```
